== illum ==

Illum is a backlight manager for linux. It changes the screen backlight level
based on keypresses (brightness up and brightness down).

=== build ===

   ./build

OR

   ./configure
   ninja

Note that `ninja` does not recognize env vars like CC and CFLAGS, but
`./configure` does. `./build` is just a convenience wrapper to configure and
then call ninja.

=== Use ===

Run `./illum-d -b /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight`.

Currently, it attaches to all event sources that supply backlight up and
backlight down keys (assuming they exist under /dev/input/* )

=== Notes ===

 - The user running illum-d needs the appropriate permisions to read from the
   input device (on Arch a member of group 'input' works) and to write to the
   backlight control

=== Dependencies ===

 - libev :: an event loop
 - libevdev :: wrapper for linux's input event system
 - ccan (as a submodule) :: misc utility code

To build:

 - sh
 - ninja

==== TODO ====

 - autodetect backlight devices
 - figure out the right way to enumerate input devices (rather than readdir of
   /dev/input)
 - Hotplug new input devices
 - Better key combo support
 - Exponential dimming curve
 - dimming based on "activity"
    - detects activity
    - obeys inhibits (time limited and lifetime limited)
    - [optionally] displays the current backlight status via an overlay
      - showing other status (caps lock, num lock) may also be useful on come
        machines
    - dim bl durring inactivity

Inspiration:

 - brightd: dims on inactivity
